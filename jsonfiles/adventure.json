        "1": "It’s almost dawn, you’re in a tavern drinking alone after a long day of jobs done. The city you’re in is the most strange city of all you’ve been, Fossburn.\nAfter a couple of drinks, the boring air strikes your mind. You need to do something, you can't be sitting that drinking and pretending to smile. You want chaos, an adventure that makes your blood burn in joy.\nSo you decide to walk to the old Mission's Board outside the tavern, right next to the wooden door. The board with only three papers hanging in there, one split in half by some random drunk man.\nYou read the first one, a handwritten note, like a normal request by some strange person.\nIn the paper is written:\n       Some may know, and some don't, but in the outskirts of Fossburn, there are some strange appearance later in the night that is haunting the citizens of the city. If someone, or some group is willing to take care of it, we would be grateful.\nReward: 300 GP BY: Gorold, The Mayor.\nThe other paper, printed in a writing machine:\nA group of bandits is destroying the houses and stores in the central market of Fossburn while we all sleep. We request a group of brave soldiers to fight against this evil and bring some peace to our minds.\nReward: 80 GP BY: Anonymous.\nAfter pondering for a while, what do you do?"
