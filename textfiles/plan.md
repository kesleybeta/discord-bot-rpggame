## CHOOSING A CLASS
**(PHB Chapter 3) provides more information**
```md
- Class (at 1st level)
  - features-capabilities 
    - including spellcasting
  - proficiencies
    - armor
    - weapons
    - skills
    - saving throws
    - tools
```

### LEVEL
**(see "Beyond 1st Level" later in this chapter).**

### HIT POINTS AND HIT DICE
**Your hit points are determined by your Hit Dice (short for Hit Point Dice).**
At 1st level, your character has 1 Hit Die, and the die type is determined by your c1ass.\
You start with hit points equal to the highest roll of that die, as indicated in your c1ass description. (You also add your Constitution modifier, which you'lI determine in step 3.) This is also your hit point maximum.\
Also record the type of Hit Die your character uses and the number of Hit Dice you have. After you rest, you can spend Hit Dice to regain hit points (see "Resting" in chapter 8).

### PROFICIENCY BONUS
The table that appears in your c1ass description shows your proficiency bonus, which is *+2* for a 1st-Ievel character.
Your proficiency bonus applies to many of the numbers you'lI be recording on your character sheet:
```md
- Attack rolls using weapons you're proficient with
- Attack rolls with spells you cast
- Ability checks using skills you're proficient in
- Ability checks using tools you're proficient with
- Saving throws you're proficient in
- Saving throw DCs for spells you cast (explained in each spellcasting c1ass)

  - Your class determines:
    - your weapon proficiencies,
    - your saving throw proficiencies,
    - and some of your skill (described in chapter 7)
    - and tool proficiencies. (tools in chapter 5.)

  - Your background gives you:
    - additional skills
    - and tolls proficiencies

  - and some races give you more proficiencies.
```
